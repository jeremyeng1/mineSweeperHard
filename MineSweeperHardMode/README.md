# Assignment4
The goal for this game is to reach the exit spot, while avoiding the mines on the field
you spawn at the bottom of the grid
the player is the spot where the number is 
the number represents how many mines are near you
you can move one space by clicking a spot within the proximity of your player (like a king in chess)
you can backtrack to retrace steps and piece together the map

Created in p5.js

Utilizes class mines and a 2d grid to randomly create a minefield, with a class player to hold the position of the player in the field.  

Project will only work on a local web server, issue with gitpage deployment.
